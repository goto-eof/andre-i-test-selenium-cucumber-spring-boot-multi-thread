# Cucumber + Selenium + Spring Boot POK

POK implemented with the latest versions of Cucumber + Selenium + Spring Boot + JDK (21). It allows to make automated
tests for a web application (in this case the target is my portfolio https://andre-i.eu).

# Moreover

- this application was developed and tested on Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- in case of browser issues, make sure that firefox or chrome were not installed from snap (but with apt-get install)
